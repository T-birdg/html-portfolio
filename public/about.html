<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Thana Gomez - a passionate programmer and web developer from Nevada. 
  I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and skills, and I love to learn new ways to 
  program and design websites.
</p>

<p>I have a strong background in programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScipt, HTML and CSS, and I am familiar with SQL and data
  structures. I'm also comfortable working with both back-end and front-end technologies.
</p>

<p>My passion for coding and development is matched by my enthusiasm for the outdoors. I love hiking, camping, and exploring new
  places. I also enjoy reading, drawing, and spending time with my friends and family.
</p>

<p>I'm always eager to take on new challenges and learn new technologies, and I'm confident that I can help you with your programming needs if you have any questions.</p>
